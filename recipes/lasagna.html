    <p>
        Lasagna was one of my favourite snacks growing up at Summer Hill and Balmain, it's peak tbh but looks plasticky and fake as hell sometimes

        I will try to eat more whole foods and meat now because I am a GOAT

        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Love</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Love yourself and thank yourself for putting in the time and effort of cooking</li>
        <li>Realise you're actually rich and get your sous chef you pay mid six figures to cook you something worth eating</li>
        <li>take the cheese and tomato, put it on a sandwich and try to eat it before your sous chef smacks it out of your hands</li>
    </ol>
